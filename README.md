#UrTran

> Chrome extension for translations


### Run extension
1) If you haven`t application built ('dist' folder is empty), build application::

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
2) Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/
3) Turn on 'Developer mode' in top right corner of page
4) Click "Load Unpacked Extension" and select directory with this project
5) Application must appear on browser`s toolbar. 
6) Reload some page and try to select some word to see translation.

######I recommend to turn off Google Translate extension, when you run UrTran, cause it feels a little uncomfortable to have both running.
