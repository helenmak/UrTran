### Run extension
1) If you haven`t application built ('dist' folder is empty), build application::

npm run build
```
2) Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/
3) Turn on 'Developer mode' in top right corner of page
4) Click "Load Unpacked Extension" and select directory with this project
5) Application must appear on browser`s toolbar. 
6) Go to page you want to translate. Reload the page in order for extension to work properly. 
Try to select some word to see translation.

###### This extension was published to Goggle Chrome Store, but currently it's on moderation. If it pass moderation quickly, you`ll see it in Chrome Store as UrTran. 

###### I recommend to turn off Google Translate extension, when you run UrTran, cause it feels a little uncomfortable to have both running.
